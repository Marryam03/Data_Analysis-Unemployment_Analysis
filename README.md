# Data_Analysis-Unemployment_Analysis
I have performed a thorough exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the New Zealand Unemployment rate dataset, including data cleaning, visualization, and hypothesis testing:
1. Data Cleaning:
   • I loaded the dataset and checked for missing values, confirming that there were no missing values.
   • I changed the ‘TimePeriod’ column to a datetime format for better analysis.
2. Data Exploration:
   • I provided an overview of the dataset, including its shape and column names.
   • I calculated and displayed descriptive statistics for the numerical attributes.
   • I visualized the unemployment rates over time, by gender, and by age groups using line plots.
   I analyzed the unemployment rate trends during COVID-19, both overall and by gender.
3. Hypothesis Testing:
   • I calculated descriptive statistics for the ‘Male’ and ‘Female’ columns during the COVID19 period.
   • I performed hypothesis tests.
After that, I have provided a test of whether there is an association between the age group “Aged 15-24 Years” and the gender “Male” during the COVID-19 period. The result was that; There is no significant association between age group and gender (the Null Hypothesis wasn’t rejected).
